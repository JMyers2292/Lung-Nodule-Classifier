# NeuralNetworks-Lung Nodule Classifier
Within this repository are MATLAB scripts which leverage a pre-trained CNN model (Inceptionv3) as well as recreating a Multi-Layered CNN (MLCNN) based off of literature.
<br><br/>
Inside the Inception folder is the .mat file of the model, as well as screenshots of the training progress at 250 and 500 epochs.
<br><br/>
Additionally, the MLCNN .mat file and screenshots are available.
